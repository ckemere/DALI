/**
 * @brief   Consumes the number of CPU cycles specified.
 *
 * @param[in] cycles  Floor number of cycles to delay.
 *                    Specifying zero will result in the maximum
 *                    possible delay. Note that guarantees at least
 *                    this number of cycles will be delayed,
 *                    not that exactly this number of cycles will be
 *                    delayed. If a more precise number of cycle delay value
 *                    is needed, GPTimer is recommended.
 *
 *                    Typical variance from this function is 10 cycles or
 *                    less assuming that the function is located in flash and
 *                    that caching is enabled. Disabling caching may result in
 *                    wait-states when fetching from flash.
 *                    Other variance occurs due:
 *                      - Amount of register stacking/unstacking around API entry/exit
 *                      - Value of cycles relative to 4-cycle loop counter
 *                      - Placement of code on a 2- or 4-byte aligned boundary
